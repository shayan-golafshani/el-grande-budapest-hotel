# The Grand Budapest Hotel 

A solo project completed by [Shayan Golafshani](https://github.com/shayan-golafshani). The project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/overlook.html).

### Description
Welcome to The Grand Budapest Hotel. Esteemed for being one of the finest places in all of Budapest, Hungary, and much of Eastern Europe. A customer using our site will be prompted to log in, and then be taken to their dashboard. Their dashboard will allow them to book a room at our establishment by selecting a date and room type optionally. Customers may only book a night at a time, but you may book as many nights as they wish in advance. In Hungary, we like to keep things simple. Once at the dashboard our fine customers will be able to see the amount of points they've accumulated at the Grand Budapest Hotel, as well as view all their past and upcoming trips.

### Wins & Challenges
#### Wins
The project spec was unclear at the start, but as I started planning out classes, everything started to materialize and come together. I'm proud
that the logic I wrote for the classes, was well written from the start, so I didn't need to go back and change it  multiple times. I learned how to communicate with classmates as peers to clarify my understanding, use git properly, and take my code back to a previously working state under immense time presure. Another win, was being able to recieve help and give help to my cohort mates during the process. We each helped each other overcome stumbling blocks and took away a greater understanding of Javascript, CSS, HTML, and how to be a better, more thoughtful, and thorough developer in general.


#### Challenges
Mentally, this project was really challenging due to it being completed in less than 5 days. There was a point where I had finished iteration 3 of the spec, and had completed a MVP (minimum viable product), but my refactoring broke the Grand Budapest Hotel app entirely. I was really close to giving up on the project entirely. However, I mentally reframed the situation and was able to use git, my previous commit history, and another branch to get back to an MVP. Luckilty, I ended up with an even cleaner solution than before. So my new mantra is "If I broke it once, I can fix it and make it better." I now truly value the power of git.
